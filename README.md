 Project proposal:
Our project is about the world of running; we are focusing on a small part of  marathons
We would like to answer the following questions about marathon runners:
Do richer countries produce better runners?
Do founding & sponsorships make a difference?
Is diet a factor in helping runners win?
Is the height of the runners an indication of their potential to sin races?

Data points we will look for:
Diet of runners (or we can use diet of a country as proxy)
Heights of runners (or we can use average height of population as proxy)
For income we will use GDP per capita 
Age or runner
